# DDA: Disclosure Data Analysis with XGBoost
A simple code for eXtreme Gradient Boosting application to Korean college disclosure data

## The aim of the code
This python code is for the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) application for college disclosure data in South Korea. XGBoost is a machine-learning algorithm famous for being highly flexible and applicable to various prediction and classification problems. It enables users to predict the colleges’ quantitative key indicators using data from the Ministry of Education of South Korea (Data available here: https://www.academyinfo.go.kr/index.do). The code applies to any quantitative data sets collected besides those indicators.

## License announcement
This code is an outcome of Dongju College’s Innovative College Korea Project (Project ICK; 2022-2024) and is shared with anyone who want to develop machine learning models using XGBoost. They can use it under MIT License.
